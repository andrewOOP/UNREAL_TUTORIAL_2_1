Unreal Engine 4 Animation Tutorial https://www.raywenderlich.com/383-unreal-engine-4-animation-tutorial

# What I Learned
How animation works in Unreal. It's very similar to how Unity does it, except the logic for the animation switching can be way more advanced in Unreal, which is very nice. You can also do it using Blueprints or even C++.

# Notes
* The options for Create Physics Asset is hidden under the advanced mesh options

* I did a different blueprint for the variables. The one they had just seemed exessive, though mine is no beauty either
